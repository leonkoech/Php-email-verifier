This projects works with phpmailer to send emails to new users who have registered to the site. If they have not clicked on the link recieved in their emails, their account is set as not active in the admin panel.
The admin can get all usernames of the people who haven't verified and who have been verified. It was a mini project I did in 2019 and wasn't sure about uploading it-like most of my projects.
